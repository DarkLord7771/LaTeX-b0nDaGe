# Bondage: A Polyglot Code Transmutation Engine

> "Write once. Transpile everywhere. Let the weak languages shatter."
> — Dark Lord, Free Bird Edition

## 🧬 What is Bondage?

Bondage is a command-line tool that:

* Takes **one logical idea** (a Python function)
* Converts it into a **Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST)**
* Translates it into **Python, C++, JavaScript, and LaTeX**
* **Validates** each version by attempting to compile it
* **Shatters language windows** that don't compile — in glorious fashion

A polyglot crucible for testing the purity of logic across paradigms.
